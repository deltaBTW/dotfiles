# | Dotfiles (unorganized) | W.I.P. btw |

My configuration files for quite a few stuff, including, but not limited to: [WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm), [fish](https://fishshell.com) and [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

You can download the files using [this tool by minhaskamal](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/).




(NOTE: these configs are done on an Arch Linux machine, so if you use a different distro, check the Credits (by scrolling to the very bottom), You will be redirected to one of the program's homepage.

# -- TERMINAL --
## Installing WezTerm, fish and starship:

run `sudo pacman -S fish starship && yay -S wezterm-git`. This will install fish, Starship and WezTerm.

then run the following 2 commands, to make fish the default shell:

`echo /usr/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells.`

then:

`chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`

restart your terminal, you should get a greeting message like this:

# Configuring the stuff:

## WezTerm: copy the [config file](https://github.com/C7DE/arch-linux-dotfiles/blob/main/wezterm/wezterm.lua) to `/home/USER/.config/wezterm/` by running this command:

`sudo cp /home/USER/Downloads/wezterm.lua ~/.config/wezterm`

## fish: you can just add the following string to the bottom of the `config.fish` file, located in `/.config/fish/`:

`starship init fish | source`

This will make sure that Starship starts, everytime you open a fish terminal

## Starship: download the [starship.toml file](https://github.com/C7DE/arch-linux-dotfiles/blob/main/starship.toml), and put it in `~/.config`

Overwrite the existing `starship.toml` file, If there is any.

### Your Terminal should look like this after you're done with all that

You can change the Arch logo with the logo of your choice, if it is available as a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icon
